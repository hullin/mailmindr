# mailmindr
Github "clone" of Arnd Issler's mailmindr, a resubmission/follow-up extension for Thunderbird. 

Original website: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/mailmindr/ 

This repository is not intended to take ownership but serves as a platform for the community to maintain this utterly important tool that appears largely abandoned by the author. In fact, the latest version (0.7.9.4) of the extension is marked as being incompatible with recent Thunderbird versions.

Original licence is MPL 1.1. To set up the github repo, I selected the closest option offered by Github, which is MPL 2.0. Until the author agrees to such upgrade, the content of the repository remains licensed under MPL 1.1.

DEVELOPERS/CONTRIBUTORS WANTED! Please contact me if you want to commit to the repository.
